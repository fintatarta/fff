# FFF: Finite Field Fun

## What is this?

This repository contains software related to the book **Finite Field Fun** (ISBN: 9791221469943) by myself (Riccardo Bernardini).  You will find here few functions that illustrate how to work in practice with finite fields.  At the moment two languages are used: *octave/matlab* and *Ada*.

The objective of the code is to be didactical rather than efficient; therefore, whenever I had the choice between efficiency and clarity I favorited the latter.

## How do I use it?

Just download the code and use it in your programs; the functions are fairly indipendent one another and there is no external dependency
